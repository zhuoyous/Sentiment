Why the Best Bike Lanes Always Get Blamed LA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs DOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on Leave\\n\\nOver a marathon three-days of testimony, the Meta Platforms Inc. co-founder and chief executive officer clearly articulated how the social media market has evolved rapidly over time \\u2014 which, if the judge agrees, could make it more difficult for the FTC to prove Meta dominates it.\\n\\nZuckerberg was composed, but occasionally evasive, when challenged to explain past emails and other private messages indicating a concerted effort to muscle out competitors.\\n\\nThose old messages and emails, gathered during the pre-trial discovery process, were more damning than his present-day testimony. The messages, often between Zuckerberg and other top Meta executives, painted a picture of an executive who was paranoid about his rivals and willing to buy competitors whenever possible.\\n\\nThe FTC is seeking to force Meta to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that the two acquisitions have given Meta an illegal monopoly over parts of the social networking industry. Emails and documents presented at trial show that Meta, then called Facebook Inc., struggled to compete in the mobile app boom in the early 2010s, buying up successful competitors. The FTC said Meta bought the companies to eliminate direct competitive threats.\\n\\nMultiple Competitors\\n\\nZuckerberg and Meta\\u2019s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Meta faces a wide array of competitors that fight for user attention, including ByteDance Ltd.\\u2019s TikTok, Google\\u2019s YouTube, Apple Inc.\\u2019s iMessage and Microsoft Corp.\\u2019s LinkedIn. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that TikTok, in particular, posed a \\u201chighly urgent\\u201d competitive threat when it sprang up in 2018.\\n\\n\\u201cWe observed that our growth slowed down dramatically,\\u201d as TikTok gained popularity, Zuckerberg said Wednesday. \\u201cIt was highly urgent, this has been a top priority for the company for several years.\\u201d Meta eventually rolled out a direct competitor, called Reels, that now drives a significant amount of video traffic for the company.\\n\\nZuckerberg was at times vague over his three days in court, and regularly disputed the FTC\\u2019s interpretations of his prior emails. As a leader, the way he communicated with staff was often blunt or harsh, and he spent time on the stand trying to add more nuance to what was written by his younger self. He occasionally clashed with FTC\\u2019s lead lawyer, Daniel Matheson, who objected at one point that Zuckerberg wasn\\u2019t answering his questions.\\n\\nStory Continues\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s unclear is how much weight those emails will ultimately have as US District Judge James Boasberg, who is presiding over the case, makes his decision. Meta has argued that the intent behind the purchases doesn\\u2019t matter, only whether those deals lead to consumer harm, which it disputes.\\n\\nBoasberg previously said the FTC will have a difficult time. Despite allowing the bulk of the case to proceed last November, Boasberg struck a skeptical tone about the FTC\\u2019s chances at trial. \\u201cPrevailing here, however, does not obscure the fact that the Commission faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial,\\u201d the judge said. \\u201cIndeed, its positions at times strain this country\\u2019s creaking antitrust precedents to their limits.\\u201d\\n\\nBoasberg also said in a ruling shortly before the trial that the FTC must prove Meta is harming competition in the present day.\\n\\nSheryl Sandberg, the company\\u2019s former chief operating officer, followed Zuckerberg on the witness stand, facing sharp questioning from FTC lawyer Susan Musser.\\n\\nIf the FTC prevails, a spinoff of Instagram and WhatsApp would undo years of integration between the apps, disrupt two of the most popular digital consumer products in the world and potentially erase hundreds of billions of dollars in Meta\\u2019s market value. It would also raise serious questions about how the government evaluates and approves deals because the government allowed the transactions to go through at the time.\\n\\n\\u2018Network Effects\\u2019\\n\\nPart of the FTC\\u2019s case involves the technical concept of \\u201cnetwork effects,\\u201d meaning that the more users a company like Meta has, the more likely they are to retain a dominant position, because people are unlikely to switch to a service used by few people.\\n\\nBoasberg has remained largely silent during the questioning, but interjected during Zuckerberg\\u2019s testimony Wednesday to ask if network effects still really matter.\\n\\n\\u201cHow much does it matter if your friends are on a particular platform if you can send content out of that platform? Why does it matter if your friends are there?\\u201d the judge said.\\n\\nZuckerberg said it doesn\\u2019t. \\u201cThese apps now serve primarily as discovery engines,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople can take that content to messaging engines.\\u201d\\n\\nBigger Company\\n\\nUnder questioning by Meta lawyer, Mark Hansen, Zuckerberg refuted the FTC\\u2019s argument that Meta bought Instagram to bury a competitor. Instagram would not likely have been able to grow to the extent it has had it remained independent, he said. \\u201cInstagram has been built out into a much more vibrant service\\u201d as a result of the deal, Zuckerberg said.\\n\\nTaking a small online platform to a billion users and beyond is unlikely to happen without the backing of a larger company, he said. \\u201cEvery company that has this level of scale is owned by a bigger company,\\u201d he said, citing TikTok and YouTube as examples.\\n\\nEarlier in the trial, it was revealed that Snap Inc.\\u2019s Evan Spiegel turned down a $6 billion acquisition offer from Facebook in 2013 for its Snapchat app. Zuckerberg said that the app would have grown more rapidly had it joined his company.\\n\\nZuckerberg sought to walk back some statements that he made in previous internal communications. He acknowledged that he sent a 2013 email saying that Facebook blocked advertising for messaging apps WeChat, Kakao and Line, in which he wrote the apps were \\u201ctrying to build social networks to replace us.\\u201d On the stand this week, however, he said \\u201cit\\u2019s hard for me to characterize what their intent was.\\u201d\\n\\nMatheson also sought to show that Meta was aware of its antitrust risk years ago, including a possible breakup.\\n\\nHe displayed an email from 2018 in which Zuckerberg suggested that Meta should consider spinning off Instagram into a standalone company. \\u201cAs calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway,\\u201d he wrote.\\n\\nAt one point, Zuckerberg was asked by Hansen to describe how he was evaluating the competitive threat posed by Instagram and others at the time of the deals.

Why the Best Bike Lanes Always Get Blamed LA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs DOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on Leave\\n\\nOver a marathon three-days of testimony, the Meta Platforms Inc. co-founder and chief executive officer clearly articulated how the social media market has evolved rapidly over time \\u2014 which, if the judge agrees, could make it more difficult for the FTC to prove Meta dominates it.\\n\\nZuckerberg was composed, but occasionally evasive, when challenged to explain past emails and other private messages indicating a concerted effort to muscle out competitors.\\n\\nThose old messages and emails, gathered during the pre-trial discovery process, were more damning than his present-day testimony. The messages, often between Zuckerberg and other top Meta executives, painted a picture of an executive who was paranoid about his rivals and willing to buy competitors whenever possible.\\n\\nThe FTC is seeking to force Meta to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that the two acquisitions have given Meta an illegal monopoly over parts of the social networking industry. Emails and documents presented at trial show that Meta, then called Facebook Inc., struggled to compete in the mobile app boom in the early 2010s, buying up successful competitors. The FTC said Meta bought the companies to eliminate direct competitive threats.\\n\\nMultiple Competitors\\n\\nZuckerberg and Meta\\u2019s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Meta faces a wide array of competitors that fight for user attention, including ByteDance Ltd.\\u2019s TikTok, Google\\u2019s YouTube, Apple Inc.\\u2019s iMessage and Microsoft Corp.\\u2019s LinkedIn. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that TikTok, in particular, posed a \\u201chighly urgent\\u201d competitive threat when it sprang up in 2018.\\n\\n\\u201cWe observed that our growth slowed down dramatically,\\u201d as TikTok gained popularity, Zuckerberg said Wednesday. \\u201cIt was highly urgent, this has been a top priority for the company for several years.\\u201d Meta eventually rolled out a direct competitor, called Reels, that now drives a significant amount of video traffic for the company.\\n\\nZuckerberg was at times vague over his three days in court, and regularly disputed the FTC\\u2019s interpretations of his prior emails. As a leader, the way he communicated with staff was often blunt or harsh, and he spent time on the stand trying to add more nuance to what was written by his younger self. He occasionally clashed with FTC\\u2019s lead lawyer, Daniel Matheson, who objected at one point that Zuckerberg wasn\\u2019t answering his questions.\\n\\nStory Continues\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s unclear is how much weight those emails will ultimately have as US District Judge James Boasberg, who is presiding over the case, makes his decision. Meta has argued that the intent behind the purchases doesn\\u2019t matter, only whether those deals lead to consumer harm, which it disputes.\\n\\nBoasberg previously said the FTC will have a difficult time. Despite allowing the bulk of the case to proceed last November, Boasberg struck a skeptical tone about the FTC\\u2019s chances at trial. \\u201cPrevailing here, however, does not obscure the fact that the Commission faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial,\\u201d the judge said. \\u201cIndeed, its positions at times strain this country\\u2019s creaking antitrust precedents to their limits.\\u201d\\n\\nBoasberg also said in a ruling shortly before the trial that the FTC must prove Meta is harming competition in the present day.\\n\\nSheryl Sandberg, the company\\u2019s former chief operating officer, followed Zuckerberg on the witness stand, facing sharp questioning from FTC lawyer Susan Musser.\\n\\nIf the FTC prevails, a spinoff of Instagram and WhatsApp would undo years of integration between the apps, disrupt two of the most popular digital consumer products in the world and potentially erase hundreds of billions of dollars in Meta\\u2019s market value. It would also raise serious questions about how the government evaluates and approves deals because the government allowed the transactions to go through at the time.\\n\\n\\u2018Network Effects\\u2019\\n\\nPart of the FTC\\u2019s case involves the technical concept of \\u201cnetwork effects,\\u201d meaning that the more users a company like Meta has, the more likely they are to retain a dominant position, because people are unlikely to switch to a service used by few people.\\n\\nBoasberg has remained largely silent during the questioning, but interjected during Zuckerberg\\u2019s testimony Wednesday to ask if network effects still really matter.\\n\\n\\u201cHow much does it matter if your friends are on a particular platform if you can send content out of that platform? Why does it matter if your friends are there?\\u201d the judge said.\\n\\nZuckerberg said it doesn\\u2019t. \\u201cThese apps now serve primarily as discovery engines,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople can take that content to messaging engines.\\u201d\\n\\nBigger Company\\n\\nUnder questioning by Meta lawyer, Mark Hansen, Zuckerberg refuted the FTC\\u2019s argument that Meta bought Instagram to bury a competitor. Instagram would not likely have been able to grow to the extent it has had it remained independent, he said. \\u201cInstagram has been built out into a much more vibrant service\\u201d as a result of the deal, Zuckerberg said.\\n\\nTaking a small online platform to a billion users and beyond is unlikely to happen without the backing of a larger company, he said. \\u201cEvery company that has this level of scale is owned by a bigger company,\\u201d he said, citing TikTok and YouTube as examples.\\n\\nEarlier in the trial, it was revealed that Snap Inc.\\u2019s Evan Spiegel turned down a $6 billion acquisition offer from Facebook in 2013 for its Snapchat app. Zuckerberg said that the app would have grown more rapidly had it joined his company.\\n\\nZuckerberg sought to walk back some statements that he made in previous internal communications. He acknowledged that he sent a 2013 email saying that Facebook blocked advertising for messaging apps WeChat, Kakao and Line, in which he wrote the apps were \\u201ctrying to build social networks to replace us.\\u201d On the stand this week, however, he said \\u201cit\\u2019s hard for me to characterize what their intent was.\\u201d\\n\\nMatheson also sought to show that Meta was aware of its antitrust risk years ago, including a possible breakup.\\n\\nHe displayed an email from 2018 in which Zuckerberg suggested that Meta should consider spinning off Instagram into a standalone company. \\u201cAs calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway,\\u201d he wrote.\\n\\nAt one point, Zuckerberg was asked by Hansen to describe how he was evaluating the competitive threat posed by Instagram and others at the time of the deals. He referenced a quote from former Intel Corp. CEO Andy Grove: \\u201cOnly the paranoid survive.\\u201d\\n\\n(Updates with color on Zuckerberg testimony starting in the first paragraph)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nGM\\u2019s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump\\u2019s America Trade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries How Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump\\u2019s Tariff Obsession Trump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose The Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\\n\\n\\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\\n\\nView Comments\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 21,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-saw-tiktok-highly-urgent-221403450.html\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gpt_response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 21,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Sentiment Score: -3\\n\\nReasoning: The news article provides a detailed account of Mark Zuckerberg's testimony in the Federal Trade Commission trial, highlighting his aggressive business decisions focused on survival and the acquisition of competitors.
