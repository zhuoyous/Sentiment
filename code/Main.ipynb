According to Morgan Stanley's latest AlphaWise survey, Apple Intelligence adoption in the U.S. is stronger than expected, and users are not only trying itthey're liking it.\\n\\nIn a note to clients Tuesday, analyst Erik Woodring said nearly 80% of eligible U.S. iPhone users have downloaded and used Apple Intelligence over the past six months. Many described it as intuitive, helpful, and something that actually improves their daily phone experience. That's a big shift from earlier skepticism among tech observers.\\n\\nThe survey also found that 42% of users said it's very important for their next iPhone to include Apple Intelligence, and among people thinking about upgrading in the next year, more than half said it's a key feature. On top of that, users said they'd be willing to pay about $9.11 per month for unlimited access, up 11% from the firm's last survey.\\n\\nLooking ahead, Woodring expects Apple to introduce a thinner iPhone and possibly even a foldable version over the next couple of yearsmoves he thinks could keep iPhone growth steady. He's sticking with his Overweight rating and $220 price target.\\n\\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\\n\\nView Comments\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-intelligence-gains-momentum-users-144204499.html\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"open\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"196.12\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"high\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"201.59\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"low\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"195.97\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"close\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"198.91\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"volume\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"25860823.0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"vwap\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"198.8815\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"transactions\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"386273.0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gpt_response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Score: 4. Reasoning: The overall sentiment towards Apple (AAPL.US) in the financial news is largely positive, indicating increased user adoption of Apple Intelligence and willingness to pay for the service.\\n\\nIn a positive development, the financial news highlights that Apple is gaining momentum with its AI features, with a high percentage of U.S. iPhone users embracing and appreciating Apple Intelligence. The survey results suggest that users find the AI feature intuitive, helpful, and enhancing their daily phone experience, marking a significant shift from earlier skepticism. The data also indicates strong demand for Apple Intelligence among users, with a notable percentage considering it a key feature for their next iPhone and willing to pay a monthly subscription fee for unlimited access. Additionally, the analyst's outlook on Apple's future innovations, such as a thinner iPhone and a foldable version, bodes well for maintaining steady iPhone growth.

Struggles in Tesla's core EV business has dogged the stock all year. Investors are laser focused on an upcoming June demonstration of the company's new Robotaxi. Top Analyst Picks: 10 Stocks We'd Buy If We Were Starting Fresh Today ›Shares of the electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla (TSLA -2.35%) traded roughly 3.3% lower as of 12:21 p.m. ET today. Sales continued to struggle in Europe and the stock also fell, despite an analyst recommending that investors hold the name.  Sales in Europe aren't improving Tesla's stock has been hit hard this year, a big part of which can be attributed to struggling global sales. The company reported roughly 337,000 deliveries in its first quarter of the year, the lowest level in over two years. Some investors believe the struggles have resulted from CEO Elon Musk's involvement in politics, which has damaged the brand.  Regardless of the reason, conditions don't seem to be improving. In April, data from the Spanish Association of Automobile and Truck Manufacturers showed that new Tesla sales fell 36% year over year, according to Reuters. Over the first four months, Tesla sales have decreased 17%, while EV sales in this time period, including hybrids, have surged 54%. It's a trend that has played out all year.\n","\n","\n","==================================================================================================== \n","\n","index: 16393, link: https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/05/05/where-will-nvidia-be-in-4-years/\n","Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 4 Years? By Keithen Drury – May 5, 2025 at 6:00AM Key Points  Nvidia sees data center capital expenditures rising to $1 trillion by 2028. Nvidia has rising competition from purpose-built hardware. These 10 Stocks Could Mint the Next Wave of Millionaires ›Nvidia (NVDA -0.64%) has been the must-own stock for the artificial intelligence (AI) race. However, it sold off a fair bit over the past few months alongside the rest of the market. Currently, it sits around 25% to 30% down from its all-time high, trading at levels last seen during the late summer of 2024.  It's not often that a sale price comes around on a big-time winner like this, but today's sale price only really matters if Nvidia is still heading in the right direction a few years from now.

The global quantum computing market is expected to grow exponentially in the coming decades. These two companies are foundational players in the quantum computing revolution. Investor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now ›Quantum computing stands at the precipice of transforming our technological landscape. In 1981, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman first proposed the concept of quantum computers, recognizing that classical machines could never efficiently simulate quantum systems.  Unlike classical computers that process information in binary bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers leverage quantum mechanics principles (superposition and entanglement) to rapidly perform complex calculations. This revolutionary approach promises to solve problems previously deemed impossible, from drug discovery and materials science to financial modeling and artificial intelligence (AI) optimization.\n","\n","\n","==================================================================================================== \n","\n","\u001b[92mUpdated: 3 / 3\n","\u001b[0m\n"]}],"source":["validate()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"id":"HhhT0V6MB59e","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746509046490,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"joey","userId":"03270544553516118182"}}},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"id":"7oScO2bbd188","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746509046491,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"joey","userId":"03270544553516118182"}}},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mYAoC2hU00rn"},"source":["## 3.
